```
I am an experienced software engineer and would like an overview how GitHub Copilot can be integrated into the software development life cycle. 
- Provide a detailed explanation of how Copilot can assist in each phase of the SDLC, including planning, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
- Include specific examples of tasks or activities within each phase where Copilot can be particularly beneficial.
